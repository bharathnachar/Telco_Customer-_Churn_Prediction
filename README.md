Telco Customer Churn Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The goal is to identify customers at high risk of leaving the service, allowing the company to take proactive measures to retain them.

The analysis is performed in a Python-based Jupyter Notebook.

üéØ Objective
To build and evaluate a machine learning model that can predict whether a customer will churn based on their demographic and service usage data.

üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries
The following Python libraries are used in this project:

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

scikit-learn: For building the machine learning models, preprocessing, and evaluation.

matplotlib & seaborn: For data visualization.

numpy: For numerical operations.

joblib: To save and load the trained machine learning model.

üìÇ Project Structure
customer_churn_prediction.py: The main script containing the entire data science workflow, including data loading, cleaning, model training, evaluation, and saving.

README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project.

telecom_churn_model.pkl: The saved machine learning model generated by the notebook, ready for deployment.

üöÄ How to Run the Notebook
Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python installed, along with the required libraries listed above. You can install them using pip:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn numpy joblib

Clone the Repository: Clone this GitHub repository to your local machine.

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git)
cd your-repository-name

Run the Script: The customer_churn_prediction.py file can be executed as a Jupyter Notebook. Open it in a Jupyter environment and run the cells sequentially.

üîç Key Steps and Findings
The notebook follows a standard machine learning pipeline:

Data Loading: The dataset is loaded directly from a public GitHub repository.

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:

Missing values in TotalCharges are handled by dropping the corresponding rows.

The customerID column is removed as it's not a predictive feature.

The target variable Churn is encoded into a numerical format (0 and 1).

Feature Engineering & Scaling:

Categorical features are one-hot encoded to be compatible with the models.

Numerical features are scaled using StandardScaler to normalize their range.

Model Training:

The data is split into training and testing sets.

Both Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier models are trained using a scikit-learn pipeline to streamline preprocessing and training.

Evaluation:

The models are evaluated based on their accuracy and a detailed classification report.

Feature Importance:

The importance of each feature in the Random Forest model is visualized to understand which factors contribute most to customer churn prediction.

Model Saving:

The trained Random Forest model is saved as telecom_churn_model.pkl for future use and deployment.

üì¶ Model Deployment
The telecom_churn_model.pkl file can be loaded into any Python environment to make predictions on new data, without needing to retrain the model.
